# Turtle Crossing
A crossing game similar to the classic game Frogger or the newer CrossyRoad.  

Use the `up` arrow or `w` key to move your turtle up. There's no going backwards. Cross the screen without getting hit
to go to the next level. Cars speed up each time you complete a level. 

Good luck!
